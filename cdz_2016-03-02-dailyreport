1. what I did?

Played with Flask Server and was able to get "Hello World" displayed on flask2.cloudapp.net

2. Issues I have

The user function I might need to implement on documentDB later on and assist in Baldwin's job to implement all of our group's APIs in 
our flask server

3. Plan moving forward

Meet with Baldwin and work on the flask to implement the APIs
